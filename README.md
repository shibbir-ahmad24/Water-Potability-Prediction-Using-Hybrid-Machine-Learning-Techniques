Nov 2023

• Developed machine learning model to predict the water potability using some parameters

• Parameters include pH level, hardness, solids concentration, chloramines, Sulfate, turbidity, etc

• Utilized machine learning algorithms like logistic regression, KNN, random forest and MLP

• Trained the models using historical data on the quality and potability of water

• Validated the accuracy of the models using testing data and performance metrics
